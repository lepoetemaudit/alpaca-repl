Alpaca Shell
=====

An experimental interactive shell for Alpaca
https://github.com/alpaca-lang/alpaca, an ML-inspired language that
runs on beam. This shell is currently limited to expressions - you cannot 
define functions (although you can bind functions in 'let' expressions!). I
intend to remove this restriction in future.
